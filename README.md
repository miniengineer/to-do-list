# To-do-list

My first to-do-list app that I made to learn the jQuery basics. 

Although it might seem that the React/Vue/Angular trio replaced good old jQuery, 
I still thought that it is worth at least to familiarise myself with this library. 

As a result, not only I was able to implement my own `render` function, 
but also it helped me to get a full understanding of React framework and its advantages.

# Description

It is a very simple to-do-app.
It's not connected to any database, so all tasks will be lost as soon as you refresh the page.

# Getting started 

It has an extremely simple dashboard.

You can add a task from the input form located on the top by simply typing the task and clicking 'SUBMIT' button or 'ENTER' keyboard button.

If you wish to delete a task, just hover the cursor on a task and when you see that it's crossed out, click on the task and it will be deleted.

If you've completed a task, just click on its checkbox and it will appear under the 'Done' section.
