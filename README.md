# To-do-list

My first to-do-list app that I made to learn the jQuery basics. 

Although it might seem that the React/Vue/Angular trio replaced good old jQuery, 
I still thought that it is worth at least to familiarise myself with this library. 

As a result, not only I was able to implement my own `render` function, 
but also it helped me to get a full understanding of React framework and its advantages.

# Description

It is a very simple to-do-app.
Unfortunately, it's not connected to any database, so all tasks will be lost as soon as you refresh the page.
